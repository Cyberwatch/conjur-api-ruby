Host#create
===========

A host is created with an identifier. The identifier must be unique.
It can be assigned, or it can be generated by Conjur. 

When the host is created, the `api_key` field is included in the JSON response.

Host#show does not include the `api_key`.

Example
-------

```bash
$ conjur host:create
{
  "id": "8y2p5w",
  "userid": "kgilpin",
  "created_at": "2013-07-09T21:12:57+00:00",
  "ownerid": "sandbox:user:kgilpin",
  "roleid": "sandbox:host:8y2p5w",
  "resource_identifier": "sandbox:host:8y2p5w",
  "api_key": "vj98ne10ar6vvmwrjt02ryfj6924a4vkch6yqcw292v9p12sv1rd"
}
$ conjur asset:show host 8y2p5w
{
  "id": "8y2p5w",
  "userid": "kgilpin",
  "created_at": "2013-07-09T21:12:57+00:00",
  "ownerid": "sandbox:user:kgilpin",
  "roleid": "sandbox:host:8y2p5w",
  "resource_identifier": "sandbox:host:8y2p5w"
}
