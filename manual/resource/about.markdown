Resource
========

A resource is an entity on which permissions are assigned. 

Resources are partitioned into "kinds", such as "group", "host",
"file", "environment", "variable", etc. 

Resources are not frequently used directly. Instead, higher-level "assets" such as Host, Group, User,
Variable provide more intuitive functionality. For example, Assets often combine role and resource
functionality together.
